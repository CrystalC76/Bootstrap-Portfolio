                <p>Hello! My name is Crystal R. Cumberledge, and I am an aspiring web developer! <br>I have been a
                    hard
                    worker since the day I turned 15! I have always been in the customer service field. My previous
                    jobs
                    include: Winn-Dixie, McDonald's, Pep Boys, Clicks Billiards, The Bank Vault, Trick Shots
                    Billiards,
                    and
                    lastly Micrologix Information Systems. I have bagged groceries, been a team leader, sold
                    auto-parts,
                    ran
                    a commercial sales department, cocktail server, bartender, bar manager, and executive assistant.
                    I
                    have
                    always excelled at any position I have held! Through these jobs I developed amazing skills like
                    the
                    ability to multitask, prioritze, organize, lead, problem solve, adapt, and manage stress. I also
                    learned
                    how to deliver excellent customer service by developing relationships, understanding their
                    needs,
                    and
                    use my innate communication and interpersonal skills. I thrive on a sense of accomplishment, and
                    love to
                    be challenged!</p>
                <P>Even though I was born in Pennsylvania, I have been in central Florida since I was 4 months old.
                    So,
                    depending on who you ask, I am pretty much a Florida native! What I love about Florida is the
                    proximity
                    to the ocean, the BEAUTIFUL weather (3 months out of the year- summer can suck it!- ha ha), and
                    the
                    theme parks! I am a roller coaster junkie!</P>
                <p>I chose this field for several reasons. I wanted to be able to make more money than what I had
                    been
                    for
                    years. Also, I am good at math, I like creating things, and I have always been a good problem
                    solver.
                    What I hope to accomplish by following this path, is a career that I enjoy, I can grow in, feel
                    challenged in, and have the potential to increase my income. Here's to a brighter future!</p>
